# VxAdmin Function

VxAdmin acts as the election setup hub at the beginning of the election and the results aggregation and reporting hub at the end of an election (and also at the end of testing).

## Configuration and Election Packages

Only a [system administrator ](user-roles.md#system-administrator-role)can authenticate onto an unconfigured VxAdmin and configure it with an election package from an external system. The election package must be loaded via a USB drive. The election package must be a valid `.zip` [election package](election-package/). If the election package zip file, election definition file, system settings file, or metadata file are not valid, VxAdmin will surface an error to the user.

Once VxAdmin is configured, system administrators and election managers can export signed election packages. The exported election package is the same as the imported election package but is accompanied by a digital signature, which ensures that the election package was validated by a certified VxAdmin. The election packages loaded into VxMark, VxScan, and VxCentralScan _must be signed_ and unsigned election packages will be rejected.

{% endhint %}

## Smart Card Management

Smart cards are used for two-factor authentication on all machines in the system. They can only be programmed at VxAdmin with system administrator privileges.&#x20;

Programming, like authentication, takes place via the laptop's built-in USB card reader. Once a card is inserted, the application is able to detect the card and read and write data by issuing APDUs (application protocol data units) which are the standard form of communication between smart card readers and smart cards.

For extensive details on the authentication scheme, see the [access control documentation](../system-security-auditing-and-logging/system-security-architecture/access-control.md).

## USB Formatting

VxSuite components require USB drives to be formatted with a FAT32 partition. The majority of USB drives are sold pre-formatted as FAT32, but some come in other formats. If an improperly formatted USB drive is inserted into a VxSuite component, it will be treated as if there is no USB drive.

VxAdmin includes a utility to format USB drives to be compatible with the system. The utility is available only to system administrators. It will rewrite the partition table on the drive to include a single partition with a FAT32 formatted filesystem that takes up all available space on the drive. The reformatting clears the USB drive and is thus a destructive action. If a USB drive is already correctly formatted, the feature can be used to clear its data. VxAdmin applies a new label to the reformatted USB drive in the form of **VxUSB-00000**, where the 0's can be any random alphanumeric characters.

Improperly formatted USB drives can only be detected and reformatted if there is _some_ partition already existing, so a USB drive without any partitions cannot be reformatted using VxAdmin.

## CVR Management

The core post-election (and pre-election testing) function of VxAdmin is loading, managing, and tallying [cast vote records ](cast-vote-records.md)(CVRs).

### Loading CVRs

CVRs must be loaded from a USB drive. CVRs are exported from VxScan or VxCentralScan and are accompanied by a digital signature. CVRs without a digital signature cannot be loaded. CVR exports with digital signatures that do not match the content of the CVR exports cannot be loaded in order to prevent tampering.&#x20;

The CVRs from the scanners are saved to specific directory structure on the USB drive, but exports can be loaded from anywhere on a USB drive's filesystem. When selecting an export manually, the export's `metadata.json` file must be selected by the user.

When loading a full CVR export, each CVR is loaded into VxAdmin's backend store as one `cvrs` record. The CVR record includes a data blob representing the votes as interpreted by the scanner, a data blob representing the mark scores for all bubbles on the ballot (if a hand-marked paper ballot), and a series of metadata fields: ballot style, voting method (absentee vs. precinct), batch, scanner, precinct, sheet number within a multi-sheet ballot, and flags for adjudication reasons such as overvotes, undervotes, write-ins, or fully blank ballots. The metadata fields are used later on for filtering or aggregating tallies or ballot counts into groups.

Each write-in on a CVR will map to a `write-ins` record, whether it is an unmarked write-in or a proper write-in. The ballot images are also each saved as database records. The write-in record links the write-in to its respective CVR, to the ballot images, and eventually to its adjudication result. The write-in adjudication interface essentially iterates through all `write-ins` records on a per contest basis.

If an error is found when loading any single CVR in a CVR export, the entire export is rejected and a message is surfaced to the user. CVRs can be rejected for a variety of reasons: authentication failed; a file is incorrectly formatted; a CVR is not for a currently valid election, precinct, ballot style, or contest; a CVR with an identical ID has been loaded with different data. In everyday use of the system, all of these errors are either rare or impossible because VxAdmin will not allow loading CVR files from elections with mismatched metadata.

VxAdmin allows loading CVR exports that have already been partially loaded. For example, imagine that VxCentralScan exports CVRs after scanning 5 ballots and then again after scanning 10 ballots. If we first load the 5 CVR export and then the 10 CVR export, the 10 CVR export will successfully load but will ignore the CVRs that have already been imported.

{% endhint %}

### Ballot Mode

VxAdmin is always in one of three ballot modes:

* Unlocked Ballot Mode - no CVRs have been loaded
* Test Ballot Mode - test CVRs have been loaded
* Official Ballot Mode - official CVRs have been loaded

On VxAdmin, the ballot mode is determined by the ballot mode of the imported CVRs. VxAdmin differs in that respect from VxMark, VxScan, and VxCentralScan, where the ballot mode is set directly by the election manager.&#x20;

Once VxAdmin is in test ballot mode, only test CVRs can be subsequently loaded. Similarly once VxAdmin is in official ballot mode, only official CVRs can be subsequently loaded.

### Removing CVRs

CVRs can be removed by the user before results are marked as official or can be removed by fully unconfiguring VxAdmin. All CVRs are removed at once. The CVR data in the database along with all its dependent data - write-ins, ballot images, and adjudications - are permanently and irrecoverably deleted from the data store.

## Adjudication

The tally reports from VxScan do not reflect any post-voting adjudication. All write-ins are simply "Write-In", unmarked write-ins are undervotes, and marginal marks are also undervotes.

VxAdmin allows election managers to perform on-screen adjudication for ballots with write-ins or marginal marks. Each contest (e.g. Mayor) is adjudicated individually. The election manager works through the queue of ballots for that contest.&#x20;

By default, only ballots with write-ins appear in the queue. If `MarginalMark` is included in the system settings as part of the list of `adminAdjudicationReasons` , ballots with marginal marks will also appear in the queue. A marginal mark is defined as any mark over a bubble which has a score of at least the `marginal`  threshold defined in the system settings but less than the `definite` threshold defined in the system settings. When both write-ins and marginal marks are being adjudicated, they appear in the following order within each contest:

1. Ballots with only write-ins
2. Ballots with both write-ins and marginal marks
3. Ballots with only marginal marks

The side of the ballot that the contest appears on is rendered to the user, with options to zoom out to the full ballot and back in again. When adjudicating a write-in, the write-in is further zoomed in. The location of the highlights are taken from the [interpreted ballot layout](cast-vote-records.md#ballot-layouts), which is included in the cast vote record and loaded into VxAdmin alongside the ballot image.

The user can adjudicate any contest option from marked to unmarked or vice versa. When presented with a marginal mark, the user can choose to leave it as an undervote or adjudicate it as marked. Write-ins can be adjudicated in one of three ways:

* **Official Candidate**: the user can select an official candidate from the list
* **Unofficial Candidates**: the user can select an unofficial write-in candidate from the list or add a new unofficial write-in candidate
* **Undervote**: the write-in can be deemed invalid, after which it will be considered as an undervote in tallies

As the user makes changes, captions are used to indicate differences between the original interpreted values and the new adjudicated values. Once the user is done adjudicating a ballot, they save their changes and continue in the queue.

Changes made in adjudication are immediately reflected in tally reports.

### Unofficial Write-In Candidates

The list of unofficial write-in candidates is created by the election manager as they adjudicate. The interface has an option to add a new write-in candidate and specify their name. That candidate will then be an option for other write-ins for the same contest. If there are no longer any adjudications that reference the unofficial candidates, their name will be removed from the list.

{% endhint %}

## Manual Tallies

VxAdmin offers a way to enter manual tallies that are then added to reports. When manual tallies are present in a results export, they are always displayed separately from scanned tallies so that users can easily recognize the impact of manual results and recognize any human errors. The only exception to this rule is the CDF election results export in which, due to the limitations of the CDF, the manual and scanned tallies are simply combined.

The ballot style, precinct, and voting method (absentee vs. precinct) must be specified before entering manual tallies. By associating manual tallies with these pieces of metadata, they can be filtered and grouped according to those dimensions when creating reports. Notably, manual tallies are not associated with a batch or a scanner like CVRs. When filtering on batch or scanner, manual tallies are excluded. When grouping by batch or scanner, manual tallies are treated as a single batch or scanner.

The manual tallies for each contest are validated according to a standard formula:

$$
\text{total ballots} * \text{votes allowed in contest} = \text{total votes} + \text{total undervotes} + \text{total overvotes}
$$

The same formula also applies to all results generated from scanned ballots. If a vote for three contest is overvoted, it is considered three overvotes. If the contest tallies entered by the user are incomplete or invalid, the user is presented with warning messages.&#x20;

In most cases, the ballot count will be the same across all contests. In some jurisdictions it is possible for different contests to have different ballot counts if, for example, someone votes on a ballot without local contests. In these cases, the user can override the ballot count on an individual contest basis.

Unofficial write-in candidates can also be allocated votes in manual tallies and new unofficial write-in candidates can be added directly from the manual tallies interface.

## Tallying & Reports

### Vote Tallying

Vote tallying is a multi-step process which takes place on the VxAdmin backend:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Every tally is specified by a set of filters and groupings. The filter defines which CVRs are excluded and included. For example, a filter might limit the CVRs to the CVRs for a specific precinct. The group determines how tallies are subdivided by CVR metadata. For example, there may be a grouping on precinct which generates tallies for each precinct separately. Groups enable multiple related tallies to be efficiently generated at once.

Filters and groupings are specified by the user directly with the tally report builder or implicitly with built-in reports.

#### Group Determination

If there are no groupings specified, there is only one set of tallies. If the precinct grouping is specified, there will be tallies for each precinct. If multiple groupings are specified, the possible resulting groupings need to be calculated. For example, if the precinct and ballot style groupings are both specified, only some combinations are possible because not all ballot styles exist in all precincts. If filters are specified, they may rule out certain groupings. For example, if the precinct grouping is specified but only Precinct A and Precinct B are included by the filter, then the Precinct C grouping will be excluded.&#x20;

If batch or scanner parameters are included, then VxAdmin will not attempt to compute the possible groupings because they may be too numerous. The potential groups will be created opportunistically during tallying.

The purpose of computing the groups when possible, rather than always creating groups opportunistically, is to know which zero tallies to expect. When we group by precinct, we'd like to generate empty results for Precinct A even if no ballots for Precinct A were cast.

**CVR Aggregation**

The CVRs are pulled from the data store one by one and their vote data is added into an ongoing tally of ballots, contest option votes, overvotes, and undervotes. If the tallies are being grouped, the CVR will be added into the group that matches its metadata e.g. a CVR from a Precinct A ballot will be added to the Precinct A group.

At this step in the process, the data does not contain any of the adjudication details from write-in adjudication.

CVR aggregation is the most computationally expensive step in the vote tallying so the results are cached. The cache is reset anytime a CVR file is added or removed or anytime a vote is adjudicated through write-in adjudication.

**Write-In Adjudication Aggregation**

The write-in adjudication records are summarized from the data store and their adjudication statuses are added into an ongoing tally of write-ins for official candidates, write-ins for unofficial candidates, invalid write-ins, and unadjudicated write-ins. They are filtered and grouped according to the same parameters as the CVRs.

{% hint style="info" %}
The write-in adjudication report is simply the results of the write-in adjudication aggregation step, without filter or group, formatted into a PDF.
{% endhint %}

#### Write-In Adjudication Hydration

The vote tallies from the CVRs are then hydrated with the aggregated write-in adjudication tallies to create vote tallies that include the results of write-in adjudication. Before hydration, the tallies represent all write-ins as generic write-ins. The counts for generic write-ins are reconciled to counts for specific official and unofficial candidates.

#### Manual Tallies Aggregation

Manual tallies are already aggregated in the sense that each can represent more than one ballot. Since they are divided by ballot style, precinct, and voting method, however, they may need to be _merged_ to match the groupings (or lack thereof) of the scanned vote tallies.

#### Manual Tallies Hydration

Manual tallies are then combined with the scanned tallies in one of two ways. For most reports, the manual tallies are paired with the scanned tallies but are not immediately added together. Reports can then display the manual and scanned tallies separately in addition to showing the total tallies. For the CDF election results report, however, the manual tallies and scanned tallies are added together because there is not a clear way to represent the difference between them in the CDF.

**Reporting**

The final step is for the VxAdmin backend to format the vote tallies into one of [VxAdmin's Results Export Formats](vxadmin-results-exports/) and export the result onto a USB drive or, if it is a PDF document, print it.&#x20;

### Ballot Count Tallying

Ballot counts are tallied as part of the vote tallying flow described above, but there is a separate tallying path that _only_ calculates the ballot counts. It is used when generating ballot count reports and exports from VxAdmin. It follows the same steps as vote tallying, but is more efficient because it can use the underlying SQLite database to generate tallies rather than iterating through each CVR one-by-one.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (40).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Ballot Count Definition

When tallying ballot counts, VxAdmin is actually tallying sheet counts. In an election where all ballots are a single sheet, there is no distinction between ballot counts and sheet counts. In an election with multi-sheet ballots, there may be different numbers of different ballot sheets. VxAdmin tallies each sheet separately, which is displayed on tally reports and ballot count reports.

The **Ballot Count** is defined in VxSuite as simply the count of first sheets. For example, if there are 1,000 first sheets and 999 second sheets, the ballot count will appear in reports as 1,000.

## Official vs. Unofficial Results

Results on VxAdmin are considered unofficial until the election manager marks them as official. As long as results are unofficial, CVRs can be loaded, write-ins can be adjudicated, and manual tallies can be added and edited. All reports and result exports are labelled as "Unofficial."&#x20;

Once the results are final and often only after a jurisdiction's specific certification process, the election manager can mark results as official. All reports and result exports will then be labelled as "Official." CVRs can no longer be loaded, write-ins can no longer be adjudicated, and manual tallies can no longer be altered.

There are two ways to exit official results mode without unconfiguring VxAdmin:&#x20;

* The system administrator can revert election results back to unofficial, which leaves all election data intact but allows it to be altered again by an election manager
* The election manager may remove _all_ election data at once, which would require restarting aggregation and adjudication from scratch

## Printer Management

VxAdmin can print reports via an attached printer. The supported printer is the HP LaserJet Pro 4001dn. VxAdmin can also export reports as PDFs so, in the event of a printer failure, reports will always be available.

VxAdmin interfaces with the printer through the CUPS, the open-source printing system developed by Apple and installed on our Debian system. When a printer is attached, it is registered with the CUPS server and made available to the application. VxAdmin is able to send print jobs to the printer via CUPS commands. The HP LaserJetPro does not require any additional third-party or in-house driver because it supports the IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) which CUPS then utilizes.&#x20;

Using IPP, the VxAdmin is also able to poll the detailed status (toner level, jam status, etc.) of the printer for use in the diagnostics interface.

VxAdmin can only connect with one printer at a time and will always connect with with the first attached printer.
