# Usability & Accessibility

VotingWorks implemented user centered design in the following ways:&#x20;

Focus on Users: Worked to understand who the users are, including voters and election administrators.  This involved conducting user research including: researching election laws and practices in different states, piloting the system to gather user feedback, and conducting feedback sessions with different types of users.&#x20;

Iterative Design: VotingWorks created several prototypes and tested these through pilot projects in Mississippi and New Hampshire. We also conducted targeted user testing to gather feedback and refine the software and hardware based on that feedback. &#x20;

Involvement of Users: From the beginning, VotingWorks incorporated user feedback sessions, pilots, and targeted testing to make sure all changes met the needs of the end user.&#x20;

Multidisciplinary Collaboration: VotingWorks gathered feedback from not just election officials and voters, but also academics and other interested stakeholders.&#x20;

Usability Testing: Finally, VotingWorks conducted formal usability and accessibility testing, as required by VVSG 2.0. \
