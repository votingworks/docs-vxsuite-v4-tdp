# Networking

All VxSuite components are blocked from connecting to any network. Thus, there is no networking in a VxSuite implementation. Our network design is secure by virtue of it being completely absent.

Networking is disabled through several layers of defense:

* Network drivers and known network connections are purged in the software setup process. See [these lines in the setup-machine.sh](https://github.com/votingworks/vxsuite-complete-system/blob/v4.0.0-rc2/setup-machine.sh#L422-L424) script.
* Secure boot ensures that the hard drive is not modified, thus preventing software that isnâ€™t part of the approved VotingWorks bundle from running.
* The network stack is disabled in the BIOS.
* Wi-fi or bluetooth hardware is not present on the machines.
* Ethernet ports are blocked.
* As a final layer of defense, a [firewall configuration](https://github.com/votingworks/vxsuite-build-system/blob/main/playbooks/trusted_build/firewalld.yaml) is defined to block any incoming or outgoing traffic in the event a connection was somehow created.

Because there is no networking, all electronic data transfer is air-gapped via USB drives.
