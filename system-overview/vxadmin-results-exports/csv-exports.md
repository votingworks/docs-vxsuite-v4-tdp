# CSV Exports

Both tally reports and ballot count reports can be exported in comma-separated values (CSV) format.&#x20;

## Tally Report CSV Structure

In the CSV tally report, the vote total for each candidate or contest option is listed in a single row. In addition, there are rows for overvote and undervote totals for a contest.

For example, here is an excerpt of a tally report including the results for one contest:

```csv
Precinct,Precinct ID,Contest,Contest ID,Selection,Selection ID,Total Votes
West Lincoln,20,Mayor,mayor,Sherlock Holmes,sherlock-holmes,0
West Lincoln,20,Mayor,mayor,Thomas Edison,thomas-edison,0
West Lincoln,20,Mayor,mayor,Write-In,write-in,0
West Lincoln,20,Mayor,mayor,Overvotes,overvotes,0
West Lincoln,20,Mayor,mayor,Undervotes,undervotes,0
```

The "Precinct" and "Precinct ID" columns are [metadata fields](csv-exports.md#shared-metadata-structure) that are included because this example export groups results by precinct. The other fields are standard fields:

<table><thead><tr><th width="162">Header</th><th>Values</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Contest</td><td>The title of the contest</td></tr><tr><td>Contest ID</td><td>The internal identifier of the contest in the election definition</td></tr><tr><td>Selection</td><td>The candidate name for candidate contests, the option label for yes-no contests, or "Overvotes" or "Undervotes"</td></tr><tr><td>Selection ID</td><td>The internal identifier of the contest option, or "overvotes" or "undervotes"</td></tr><tr><td>Total Votes</td><td>The vote count for the selection</td></tr></tbody></table>

If manual results were entered, two additional columns will be added - "Scanned Votes" and "Manual Votes." These columns denote which votes for each selection came from the scanners vs manual entry.

The results of write-in adjudication are always included in the CSV exports. All write-in candidates will appear with their adjudicated name and a UUID assigned by VxAdmin. Unadjudicated write-in candidates will appear as "Unadjudicated Write-In" with the ID "write-in". Unlike in the printed reports, write-in candidates are never consolidated.&#x20;

## Ballot Count Report CSV Structure

The ballot count report CSV is the same as the table presented in the [printed ballot count reports](ballot-count-reports.md). For example:

```csv
Precinct,Precinct ID,Voting Method,BMD,HMPB,Total
West Lincoln,20,Precinct,0,0,0
West Lincoln,20,Absentee,0,0,0
East Lincoln,21,Precinct,0,0,0
East Lincoln,21,Absentee,0,0,0
South Lincoln,22,Precinct,0,0,0
South Lincoln,22,Absentee,0,0,0
North Lincoln,23,Precinct,0,0,0
North Lincoln,23,Absentee,0,0,0
```

The "Precinct", "Precinct ID" and "Voting Method" columns are [metadata fields](csv-exports.md#shared-metadata-structure) that are included because this example export groups results by precinct and voting method. The other fields are standard fields:

<table><thead><tr><th width="172">Header</th><th>Values</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>BMD</td><td>The count of machine marked ballots</td></tr><tr><td>HMPB</td><td>The count of hand marked paper ballots. In a multi-sheet election, this is just the count of the first sheet</td></tr><tr><td>HMPB Sheet {N}</td><td>The count of a particular ballot sheet. The count of the second sheet of all ballots would be "HMPB Sheet 2"</td></tr><tr><td>Manual</td><td>The count of manually entered ballots</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>The total ballot count</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Shared Metadata Structure

Any filters or groupings which apply to each row will be indicated in the row itself by metadata columns. For example, in the example export above, the "Precinct" column lists which precinct group each row represents.

If a row is filtered by a single attribute value (e.g. represents one precinct rather than multiple precincts) then the following basic metadata fields are used:

<table><thead><tr><th width="173">Header</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Precinct</td><td>The name of the precinct</td></tr><tr><td>Precinct ID</td><td>The identifier of the precinct from the election definition</td></tr><tr><td>Party</td><td>The short name of the party e.g. "Republican". Included by default if the ballot style is included, in a primary.</td></tr><tr><td>Party ID</td><td>The identifier of the party from the election definition</td></tr><tr><td>Ballot Style ID</td><td>The identifier of the ballot style</td></tr><tr><td>Voting Method</td><td>"Absentee", "Precinct", or "Provisional"</td></tr><tr><td>Scanner ID</td><td>The serial number of the scanner. Included by default if the batch is included.</td></tr><tr><td>Batch</td><td>The label of the scanned batch</td></tr><tr><td>Batch ID</td><td>The scanner-assigned UUID of the scanned batch</td></tr></tbody></table>

If a row is filtered by multiple attribute values, the following columns may be used:

<table><thead><tr><th width="236">Header</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Included Precincts</td><td>The precinct identifiers separated by commas</td></tr><tr><td>Included Parties</td><td>The party identifiers separated by commas</td></tr><tr><td>Included Ballot Styles</td><td>The ballot style identifiers separated by commas</td></tr><tr><td>Included Voting Methods</td><td>The voting method labels ("Precinct", "Absentee", or "Provisional") separated by commas</td></tr><tr><td>Included Scanners</td><td>The scanner serial numbers separated by commas</td></tr><tr><td>Included Batches</td><td>The batch identifiers separated by commas</td></tr></tbody></table>

In cases as above, where a row value includes comma-separated values, those values will be wrapped in quotation marks per typical CSV formatting in order to allow consumers to properly differentiate columns.
