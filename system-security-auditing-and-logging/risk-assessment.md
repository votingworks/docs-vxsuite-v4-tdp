# Risk Assessment

This risk assessment reviews threats and vulnerabilities identified in:

* VxSuite hardware, including VxCentralScan, VxAdmin, vxMark, and VxScan. Also included are any items and peripherals needed to operate the equipment listed above (e.g., USB drives, scanners, printers).
* VxSuite software and source code
* VotingWorks internal communication and operation support systems.

This assessment was conducted following the framework outlined in NIST Special Publication 800-30 - Guide for Conducting Risk assessments.
