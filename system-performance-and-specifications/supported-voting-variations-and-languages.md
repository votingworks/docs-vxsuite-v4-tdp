# Supported Voting Variations & Languages

## Supported Voting Variations

* N-of-M contests
* Yes/No contests
* Partisan Primary Elections
  * The voting system itself does not have a concept of an open vs. closed primary as primary ballot styles are restricted to one party, but can support both types of primaries through procedurally restricting a voter to a given ballot style.

## Supported Languages

* English
* Spanish
* Chinese (Simplified & Traditional)

Voter-facing content in an election package can be translated to additional left-to-right languages and imported into VxSuite, but is not formally supported or tested by VotingWorks.
