# Tally Reports

## Basic Structure

The basic structure of the tally reports printed from VxAdmin is generally similar to the [polls opened and closed reports](../vxscan-polls-reports.md) printed from VxScan.

## Filtered and Grouped Reports

In addition to the full election report, VxAdmin exports reports filtered or grouped by the following dimensions:

* Ballot Style
* Precinct
* Voting Method
* Scanner
* Batch
* District (filtering only)

When a report is grouped, the report is broken up into multiple sections each with their own filter. For example, if you were to group by "Voting Method," the resulting report would have a section filtered for precinct ballots only and a section filtered for absentee ballots only:

The filter for a given report section is indicated in the title of the report. If the report has more than one filter applied to it, the full details of the filter will be specified at the top of the report:

Note that filters and groups can be combined, so there may be report filtered by&#x20;

## Manual Results

If manual results have been added, they will be be included in the report separately from scanned results:

## Write-In Candidate Aggregation

In order to prevent a long list of write-in candidates from making contest results difficult to read, VxAdmin tally reports consolidate write-in candidates if they're not relevant to the contest outcome. Relevant write-ins are included as "Name (Write-In)". Irrelevant write-ins are bucketed as "Write-In" or, if there are relevant write-ins in the list, "Other Write-In". Unajudicated write-ins are always bucketed under "Unadjudicated Write-In."

A write-in is deemed relevant if it must be listed for the reader to determine the winner(s) of the contest. In the middle example below, the single adjudicated write-in is bucketed because _Natalie Portman_ is the winner regardless of the idenities of the write-ins. In the last example, however, there are 31 adjudicated write-ins so it's possible that a write-in got more votes than _Natalie Portman_. The report then enumerates the write-ins with the highest vote totals until the "Other Write-In" count is smaller than the counts for all winners.&#x20;
