# Physical Security

In addition to the processes in [procedural-and-operational-security.md](procedural-and-operational-security.md "mention"), VxSuite employs the following physical security controls for each component.

## VxAdmin

* VxAdmin laptops are stored and transported in a case with two tamper-evident seal points to detect any unauthorized physical access.
* VxAdmin laptops have a tamper evident adhesive seal on the laptop itself to detect any unauthorized physical access to the laptop internals.
* VxAdmin laptops BIOS configurations do not allow the machine to boot if the laptop itself is opened without entering a vendor-only password & returning the device to VotingWorks.
* VxAdmin has no exposed ports that are not used for voting system operations. VxAdmin's printer has an ethernet port blocker installed.

## VxCentralScan

* VxCentralScan laptops are stored and transported in a case with two tamper-evident seal points to detect any unauthorized physical access.
* VxCentralScan laptops have a tamper evident adhesive seal on the laptop itself to detect any unauthorized physical access to the laptop internals.
* VxCentralScan laptops BIOS configurations do not allow the machine to boot if the laptop itself is opened without entering a vendor-only password & returning the device to VotingWorks.
* VxCentralScan has no exposed ports that are not used for voting system operations. VxCentralScan's attached batch-scanner (fi-8170) has an ethernet port blocker installed.

## VxScan

* VxScan has two external tamper-evident seal points to detect any unauthorized physical access.
* VxScan has three interior adhesive tamper-evident seals (1 on top panel; 2 on bottom panel) to detect any unauthorized access to the device internals.
* VxScan has a tamper-evident seal point at the intersection of the poll worker door and security bolt to ensure secure ballot box attachment and detect any unauthorized access to poll worker functions.
* VxScan's ballot box has a seal point for each ballot storage area (main & auxiliary compartments) to detect any unauthorized access to cast ballots.
* VxScan triggers a visual & audible alert when a USB drive is removed in an activated state to alert any unauthorized access.
* VxScan has no exposed ports when the poll worker door is sealed.

## VxMark

* VxMark transport & storage cases have several tamper-evident seal points to detect any unauthorized physical access.
* VxMark has an adhesive tamper-evident seal on each side of the BMD to detect any unauthorized physical access to the device internals.
* VxMark ballot box has a tamper-evident seal point to detect any unauthorized access to cast ballots and the printer-scanner.
* VxMark triggers a visual & audible alert when the printer-scanner and/or printer-scanner cover is opened in an activated state to alert any unauthorized access.
* VxMark has no exposed ports when the ballot box is attached and sealed. An ethernet port blocker is also installed on the ethernet port accessible when the ballot box is detached.
