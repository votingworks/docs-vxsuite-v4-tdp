# Warranty Model

## **TDP Warranty Responses**

D         Discussion           A number of factors associated with the durability of a product or its components can be highly variable and even particular to the type of components (e.g., COTS, consumables). This variance is also applicable to the resources of a given manufacturer. Thus, instead of prescribing a pre-estimated number for all manufacturers, the manufacturers are asked to make these estimates relative to their own products, components, and resources, and to provide the basis for these estimates (these warranties, replacement periods, etc.) to the EAC, labs, and customers. In this way, manufacturers can perform estimates most relevant to their chosen manufacturing strategies (i.e., COTS-centric vs. custom-built, and so on).
