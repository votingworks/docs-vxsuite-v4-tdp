# Quality Assurance Manual

**TA2.1.1.-A.1 1**: documenting QA protocols (whole document)

Each section of the protocol should include a comprehensive list of all the VVSG requirements and how they're tested here. For example, CVR export compliant with CDF if tested within unit tests.

We will document the following at the high-level, for example, in "automated unit tests", we will specify:

* 1.3-A.3 pass-fail criteria: automated test passes
* 1.3-A.4 evidence: proof of test passing in CI
* 1.3-A.5 test procedures: how to run the automated unit tests
* 1.3-A.6 if necessary, variations in results (e.g. randomness, flakiness)
* 1.3-A.7 any cleanup procedures for the test results or data.
* 1.3-A.8 report of actual tests being run

Table should then provide details for each requirement:

<table><thead><tr><th width="205">1.3-A.1 Requirement</th><th width="181">1.3-A.2 Items Tested</th><th width="210">1.3-B Details of this test</th><th>1.3-A.9 exceptional circumstances</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
