# Vulnerability Management

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

VotingWorks' vulnerability disclosure policy is publicly available here: [https://github.com/votingworks/vxsuite/security/policy](https://github.com/votingworks/vxsuite/security/policy)

The public disclosure policy provides instructions on how to report a vulnerability, where to see known vulnerabilities, and the coordinated vulnerability disclosure process VotingWorks follows.

### Patch Management Plan

We handle vulnerabilities using the following coordinated vulnerability disclosure process:

* The reporter reports the vulnerability privately to VotingWorks.
* VotingWorks works privately with the reporter to understand the vulnerability, with an initial response within 10 business days of receipt of the report.
* VotingWorks prepares fixes as needed for reported vulnerabilities. Some fixes will be operational, others in software, and others potentially in hardware. Where the issues affect a third-party component, VotingWorks will do its best to coordinate advisories and disclosures with other involved parties.
* When fixes require certification by the appropriate agencies, notably the Election Assistance Commission, VotingWorks works with these agencies to certify the fixes.
* VotingWorks privately works with affected jurisdictions to deploy mitigations and fixes.
* VotingWorks assigns a CVE for the vulnerability and publishes the vulnerability on the disclosure page, giving credit to the reporter if they choose to take credit. VotingWorks reserves the assignment of a CVE to confirmed security issues on products that have not been end-of-lifeâ€™d.

## Known Vulnerabilities Not of Concern

Given the protection mechanisms we use to prevent unauthorized software from running on VxSuite components, the simplest way to perform a vulnerability scan is to use Nessus in a host operating system, with VxSuite components running as guest virtual machines (VMs). We turn off our networking blocks on those VMs for the sake of performing a useful vulnerability scan.

On each of these components, the same vulnerabilities are found by Nessus. There are 15, and they are all in the "Info" category of vulnerability, meaning that they only allow for information gathering about the host, not for any corruption or direct attack. **All of these issues are listed here, with an explanation as to why they are not vulnerabilities of concern.**

Even if it did, it only allows an attacker to determine what kind of devices this is (manufacturer, CPU power, etc.). This is considered public information, so is not a threat.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/86420">86420</a></td><td>Ethernet MAC Addresses</td><td>With networking protections in place like they are on a production machine, this issue would not exist. Even if it did, it only allows an attacker to determine the MAC address of an Ethernet port, which isn't a threat.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/43111">43111</a></td><td>HTTP Methods Allowed (per directory)</td><td>With networking protections in place like they are on a production machine, this issue would not exist. VxSuite uses HTTP internally within each component, so with networking protections turned off, it is obvious that allowed HTTP methods can be detected. This isn't an issue on a production system.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/24260">24260</a></td><td>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Information</td><td>With networking protections in place like they are on a production machine, this issue would not exist.
