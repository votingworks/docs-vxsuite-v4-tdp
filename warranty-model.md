## Estimated Warranty Types and Costs

VotingWorks requires all voting equipment customers to purchase our Technology Repair, Upgrade, Support and Training (“Trust”) Services. TRUST Services will cover warranty for all products purchased. Average annual cost of TRUST Services will not exceed 5% of the equipment purchase price for years 1-10.

## Associated Replacement Policies, Services, and Available Maintenance Agreements

A sample TRUST Services Agreement is available at [https://github.com/votingworks/docs-vxsuite-v4/tree/main/warranty-model](https://github.com/votingworks/docs-vxsuite-v4/tree/main/warranty-model)

### Plans for Collecting, Maintaining, and Reporting Data to the EAC to Support and Validate Estimates

VotingWorks will continually collect data on warranty usage at the product level and compile such data into reports. VotingWorks will share this data with the EAC at least every two years.
