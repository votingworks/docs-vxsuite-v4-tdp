# VxAdmin & VxCentralScan Hardware

## Functional Overview

\[insert images and explanations]

## Bill of Materials

All components for VxAdmin and VxCentralScan are commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Data sheets and related documentation are available [in the documentation repository](https://github.com/votingworks/vxsuite-v4-documentation/tree/main/hardware-assets/cots-documentation/central-system).

### VxCentralScan Components (Scanner)

VxCentralScan can be used with either the Ricoh fi-8170 or the Ricoh fi-7600, but does not need both. Each scanner can be paired with one of the two imprinters listed below.

## Laptop Specification

The laptop is a custom configuration of the widely available HP Elitebook 840 11" G11 laptop. B43P6UP#ABA is the HP SKU of the VotingWorks configuration, which includes the following:

## Discussion of Critical Components

As listed in the bill of materials above, the high criticality components are as follows:

* **HP Elitebook 840 11" G11** - As the processor and data store for ballot data and other tallies, the laptops are one of the most critical components in the entire system. HP is the only manufacturer. VotingWorks is an official OEM partner of HP in order to work closely together to ensure the quality and configuration of the laptops.
* **Ricoh fi-7600 & fi-8170** - As the source of ballot images for VxCentralScan, the Ricoh scanners are highly sensitive and critical components.

The medium criticality components and the reasons for their classification are as follows:

* **Tripp Lite Ultra Slim USB Hub** - Manages flow of data between laptop and peripherals.
* **Logitech B100 Mouse -** Does not directly handle election data but does plug into a USB port, thus it could still pose a USB attack vector.
* **Monoprice USB A-B Cable -** Manages flow of data between laptop and peripherals.
* **HP LaserJet Pro 4001dn -** The VxAdmin printer is responsible for printing reports from VxAdmin and therefore handles highly sensitive election information. All reports from VxAdmin can be exported as PDFs and printed elsewhere, so it is not strictly necessary for the operation of the system and thus is not the highest criticality.
* **Ricoh fi-760PRB & fi-819PRB** - The imprinters that pair with the Ricoh scanners are not involved in generating ballot data, so they cannot influence the interpretation of ballots when used according to instructions. The imprinted identifiers are important for post-election audits, however, so the imprinters are security-sensitive components.
